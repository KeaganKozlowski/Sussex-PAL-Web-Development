Over the course of this workshop we will work to develop a Full Stack Application capable of improving the job search.

In this case the project will be creating an application which is capable of showing the user a job listing and swipe left (reject) and swipe right (like), and if they swipe right the job will be saved so that the user can apply to the job. Which basically means that this application will work similar to how dating apps work.
